                I am currently enrolled as Second Year Student at Charotar University of Science and Technology pursuing Bachelor of Technology
                in Computer Engineering at Chandubhai S. Patel Inistitute of Technology under U & P U Patel Department of Computer Engineering.
                <br />
                I completed my Higher Secondary Education from Shree Gattu Vidyalaya which is located in Ankleshwar.
                <br />
                I love Astronomy.
                <br />

                "It has been said that Astronomy is a humble and a character building experience." -Carl Sagan
                <br />
                One of the Great things about Astronomy is to learn and discover something which is bigger than one self and one's ego. 
                When you realize that none of the petty daily life problems matter in the large scale of the Universe, a sense of humility
                is awaken within an individual which is I guess one of the few notable qualities one can possess in this era.
