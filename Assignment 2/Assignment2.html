                        A quasar (/ˈkweɪzɑːr/) (also known as a quasi-stellar object abbreviated QSO) is an extremely luminous active 
                        galactic nucleus (AGN), in which a supermassive black hole with mass ranging from millions to billions of times the mass
                         of the Sun is surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk. As gas in the disk falls towards the black hole, energy is 
                         released in the form of electromagnetic radiation, which can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. 
                         The power radiated by quasars is enormous: the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than 
                         a galaxy such as the Milky Way

                        The term quasar originated as a contraction of quasi-stellar [star-like] radio source, because quasars were first 
                        identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin, and when identified in 
                        photographic images at visible wavelengths they resembled faint star-like points of light.

                        In gamma-ray astronomy, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant 
                        galaxies. They are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe.These GRBs can last from ten 
                        milliseconds to several hours. After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually 
                        emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio).

                        The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released during a supernova or superluminous supernova as a
                        high-mass star implodes to form a neutron star or a black hole.

                        The sources of most GRBs are billions of light years away from Earth, implying that the explosions are both extremely 
                        energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year 
                        lifetime)[7] and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years[8]). It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the 
                         Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.[9]

                        A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, 
                        hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object, 
                        including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda 
                        Nebula before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the 
                        early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

                        Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula that is visible to the human eye 
                        from Earth would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The Orion Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky and
                        occupying an area twice the diameter of the full Moon, can be viewed with the naked eye but was missed by early 
                        astronomers. Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created 
                        on Earth.

                        A neutron star is the collapsed core of a giant star which before collapse had a total mass of between 10 and 29 solar 
                        masses. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars, excluding black holes, hypothetical white holes, quark stars 
                        and strange stars.[1] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar 
                        masses.[2] They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that 
                        compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.

                        Once formed, they no longer actively generate heat, and cool over time; however, they may still evolve further through 
                        collision or accretion. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely
                         of neutrons (subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons); the electrons 
                         and protons present in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions in a neutron star.
